#### Category: Health, wellness and fitness
#### Type: Natural Language Processing

### Background & Situation 
-Chest X-rays: most common imaging procedures in medicine: images of our heart, lungs, blood vessels, airways, and the bones of our chest and spine. These images are used to diagnose conditons and complied in a report as impressions to determine whether a patient has heart problems, a collapsed lung, pneumonia, broken ribs, emphysema, cancer or any of several other conditions. 

-To minimize time it takes for emergent findings to be communicated, there needs to be a tool that could triage the abnormal cases to the head of the queue to be read  by a radiologist.
